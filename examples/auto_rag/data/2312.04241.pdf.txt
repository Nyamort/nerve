Abstract. This work is concerned with an inverse scattering problem of determining
unknown scatterers from time-dependent acoustic measurements. A novel time-domain
direct sampling method is developed to efficiently determine both the locations and
shapes of inhomogeneous media. In particular, our approach is very easy to implement since only cheap space-time integrations are involved in the evaluation of the
imaging functionals. Based on the Fourier-Laplace transform, we establish an inherent
connection between the time-domain and frequency-domain direct sampling method.
Moreover, rigorous theoretical justifications and numerical experiments are provided to
verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed method.
Keywords: time-domain direct sampling method, Fourier-Laplace transform, inverse
scattering problem, acoustic wave.

1. Introduction
In this paper, we consider an inverse acoustic scattering problem of reconstructing
unknown objects by the associated time-dependent near-field measurements. This type
of inverse problem arises in a variety of practical applications and it attracts significant
attentions in many fields of science and technology, such as sonar detection, medical
imaging [23], non-destructive testing [2] and so on.
To begin with, we present the mathematical formulation of the time-dependent acoustic
scattering problem in the inhomogeneous medium. Let c0 ∈ R+ denote the background
sound speed and c(x) ∈ L∞ (Rd ), d = 2, 3, be the sound speed in the inhomogeneous
medium with c(x) > 0. Suppose that c(x) − c0 is compactly supported in Ω ∈ Rd and
Rd \Ω is connected, where Ω is occupied by the inhomogeneous medium. We further
assume that the incident wave pi (x, t) is a causal signal (that is, pi (x, t) ≡ 0 for t ≤ 0)
emitted from a point x ∈ Rd \Ω. Given the incident wave pi and the medium scatterer
Ω, the forward scattering problem is to find the scattered field ps (x, t) that satisfies the
following wave equation

−2
i
c−2 (x)∂tt ps (x, t) − ∆ps (x, t) = c−2
(x, t) ∈ Rd × R+ ,
0 − c (x) ∂tt p (x, t),
(1.1)
ps (x, 0) = ∂t ps (x, 0) = 0,
x ∈ Rd .
The well-posedness of the forward scattering problem (1.1) can be conveniently found
in [4, 16]. Throughout, let Γ ⊂ Rd \Ω be a closed or an open measurement surface such
that the receivers are away from the target objects. Define the measured scattered field
by
Λ := {ps (x, t) : (x, t) ∈ Γ × R+ }.
The inverse problem that we are concerned with is to determine the locations and shapes
of the medium scatterers Ω by the knowledge of the near-field measurements Λ. Figure
1 provides a schematic illustration of the time-domain scattering problem in R2 . It is
noted that the unknown objects can be uniquely determined by boundary measurements

Λ with a single incident wave when the sound speed c(x) is non-trapping and close to a
constant [25].
In recent decades, many numerical methods have been developed to deal with the
above inverse scattering problem. Among various reconstruction approaches, we are
particularly interested in the so-called sampling-type methods. This class of approaches
resort to establishing imaging functionals to distinguish whether a sampling point is
inside or outside the scatterer’s domain and hence can qualitatively identify the location
and shape of the unknown scatterer [11]. Significantly, sampling-type methods possess
several advantages in contrast to conventional iterative approaches. On the one hand,
these sampling-type approaches are independent on the a priori information of scatterer’s
physical properties or boundary conditions. On the other hand, these imaging functionals
can be computed in a very efficient way and they are also robust to the noise.
Depending on whether directly using the measured time-dependent data, the samplingtype methods can be classified into two categories: time-domain ones and frequencydomain ones. The time-domain sampling methods primarily utilize the measured timedependent scattered field to determine the unknown objects. We refer the reader to
the time reversal method [2, 12], the synthetic aperture radar technique [10], the total
focusing method [18] and so on [19, 28]. However, if the measured data changes rapidly
over a short period of time, it is difficult to use the time-domain methods [31]. In such
cases, one usually transforms the time-dependent data into frequency domain and utilizes
the frequency-domain methods to recover unknown scatterers. For the frequency-domain
sampling methods, interested readers could refer the linear sampling method [5, 21], the
factorization method [3, 14], the probe method [26], the direct sampling method [13, 22]
and so on [8, 24].
In comparison to time-domain sampling methods, the frequency-domain ones can offer
better stability and computational efficiency, whereas they require a large amount of
multi-static data on a large spatial aperture. In order to decrease the number of sources
and receivers, the linear sampling method and factorization method were extended to
the time domain, see e.g. [6,9,16,17]. Actually, the time-domain linear sampling method

and factorization method were hindered by the theoretical difficulty associated with the
interior transmission eigenvalue problems for a long time. Until recently, the solvability
of the time-domain linear sampling method were rigorous justified in [7,27]. Nevertheless,
the classical direct sampling method [13] does not suffer the that interior transmission
eigenvalue problems. Moreover, to our best knowledge, the time-domain direct sampling
method has not yet been established in the literature although there are some attempts
[15,32]. The major challenge of the time-domain direct sampling method lies in the design
of the imaging functionals. Hence, it has important theoretical and practical significance
to propose an efficient time-domain direct sampling method.
The goal of this article is to develop a novel time-domain direct sampling method for
reconstructing the locations and shapes of unknown targets. We first directly present the
imaging/indicator functionals for the inverse acoustic scattering problems in both two
and three dimensions as follows:

where z ∈ D denotes the sampling point, ps is the time-dependent scattered field and

Here σ ≥ 0 is a constant and it depends on the the waveform of the incident wave.
In this work, we first designed a novel imaging function (1.2) for the time-domain
direct sampling method. Then we establish the inherent connection between the timedomain and classical frequency-domain direct sampling method [13] based on the FourierLaplace transform. Furthermore, we present rigorous mathematical analysis to justify the
indicator behaviour of the proposed imaging functionals (1.2) in the scenario involving the
point-like scatterers. The promising features of our time-domain direct sampling method
can be summarized in three aspects. Firstly, the method involves formulating imaging
functions by directly convoluting time-dependent scattered data with a test function.
Moreover, the imaging functions do not rely on any matrix inversion or forward solution
process. Thus, our approach is easy to implement with high computational efficiency.
Secondly, in comparison to the total focusing method [18], the proposed method not only
utilizes the travel time information of the recorded acoustic data but also makes use of
the echo amplitude of the scattered field. Thus, our approach theoretically has better
imaging performance in recovering unknown objects. Thirdly, the proposed method has
nearly no restrictions on the waveform of the incident wave. Regardless of whether the
input signal is an impulse function, a periodic function or a tempered function, the
imaging functions can demonstrate excellent performance when a suitable parameter σ
is selected. Hence, our approach can be generalized to more practical scenarios since it
could handle a wide range of input signals.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Sobolev spaces
and the Fourier-Laplace transform. Moreover, we present some mathematical preliminaries for the acoustic wave equation in both time- and frequency-domain. In section 3,
we first establish the connection between the time-domain and frequency-domain direct
sampling method. Further, we show the behaviour of the indicator functions. Numerical
experiments are conducted in section 4 to verify the promising features of our method.

2. Fourier-Laplace transform and forward scattering problem
In this section, we provide some mathematical preliminaries for the time-domain acoustic wave equation.
We begin with the introduction of some space-time Sobolev spaces and the FourierLaplace transform. Let X be a Hilbert space, we define the space D(R, X) as the Xvalued C0∞ functions on the real line with support in (−∞, ∞) and the space D′ (R, X)
as the associated X-valued distributions. Moreover, we define the space S(R, X) as the
Schwartz space of infinitely differentiable X-valued functions on the real line and the
space S ′ (R, X) as the corresponding tempered distributions. In order to describe the
Fourier-Laplace transform, we define the following Sobolev spaces
L′σ (R, X) := {f ∈ D′ (R, X) : e−σt f ∈ S ′ (R, X)},

σ ∈ R.

It is clear that the Fourier transform of e−σt f can be represented by
Z +∞
−σt
F[e f ](ξ) =
eiξt e−σt f (t) dt, ξ ∈ R.
−∞

Let ω = ξ + iσ for ξ, σ ∈ R, we define a half-plane by
Cσ0 = {ω ∈ C : Im(ω) ≥ σ0 > 0}
Thus, the Fourier transform can be rewritten as the following Fourier-Laplace transform
Z +∞
b
f (ω) =
eiωt f (t) dt, ω ∈ Cσ0 .

Indeed, the inverse Laplace transform is given by

To characterize the time-dependent wave field, we also define the Hilbert space

for m ∈ R and σ ∈ R. For more details, please refer to the reference [30]. In additon, it is
worthy to mention that the Fourier-Laplace transform transfers to the standard Fourier
transform when ℑω = 0.
Next, we introduce the acoustic wave propagation and scattering in the inhomogeneous
medium. Throughout, we assume that the incident field is generated by a single monopole
source with a causal temporal signal χ(t) ∈ C 2 (R), that is χ(t) ≡ 0 for t ≤ 0. Then the
incident wave pi ∈ Hσm (R, L2 (Rd )) emitted at the source location y ∈ Rd satisfies the
homogeneous wave equations

admits the following equation

where p := pi + ps ∈ Hσm (R, H 1 (Rd )) denotes the total field. Noting that c(x) − c0 is
compactly supported in Ω ∈ Rd , using the time-domain Green’s formula, the scattered
field can be represented by

Recalling the Lippmann-Schwinger equation [11, p.310], one can find that the solution
to the last equation is given by

Here H0 denotes the Hankel function of the first kind with order zero. Thus, pbs is a
frequecy-domain formula to the time-domain scattered field ps defined in (2.6).
3. Theoretical analysis of the time-domain direct sampling method
In this section, we aim to establish the rigorous theoretical analysis to determine the
locations of the multiple small scatterers based on the behavior of indicator functions
(1.2). The key technique is to transform the time-domain imaging functions into the
Laplace domain and discuss the properties of imaging functions in the frequency domain.
We first present the Laplace-domain representation of the indicator functions in the
following theorem.

as the multi-frequency frequency-domain direct sampling method when σ = 0. Actually,
our proposed method is essentially a generalized version of the multi-frequency frequencydomain direct sampling method since the parameter σ can also be selected as σ > 0.
To fully characterize the time-domain direct sampling method, as stated in Theorem
3.1, we just need to analyze the properties of the indicator functions defined in (3.1). To
accomplish this, we first present a crucial lemma. For simplification, we define

We are now ready to present the behavior of the imaging functions (1.2), which plays
an important role in determining the locations of the point-like scatterers. Before the
discussion, we give two assumptions that play important roles in the sequel. Firstly, we
assume that the medium domain Ω consists of a finite number of well-separated small
domains, i.e.,
N
[
Ω :=
Ωj , N ∈ N.
(3.10)
j=1

Secondly, let ℜ(ω0 ) := inf ω∈Cσ0 ℜ(ω) be the lowest frequency of the incident signal χ(t)
such that

where c0 is the background sound speed. In the following, we denote by B(y0 , R) the
circle/ball centered at y0 with R, namely, B(y0 , R) = {y ∈ Rd : |y − y0 | < R}.
Theorem 3.2. Let Γ := {x ∈ Rd \Ω : |x| = r} denote a circle (d = 2) or a sphere (d = 3)
with radius r, c0 > 0 denotes the background sound speed and σ > 0 be a positive constant.
Suppose that the assumptions (3.10) and (3.11) hold, then the indicator functions I (d) (z)

Remark 3.2. Theorem 3.2 asserts that the imaging functional (1.2) attains its local maximum at the location of the targets and it decays rapidly when the sampling point is
away from the scatterers. Thus, one can identify the point-like scatterers based on the
behaviour of the imaging functionals. Furthermore, to improve the resolution of the
imaging, one should choose a higher lowest frequency ℜ(ω0 ), a larger observation radius
r and finer sampling grid.
Remark 3.3. It is worthy to emphasize that the parameter σ plays a significant role in the
imaging functionals. On the one hand, if the L2 norm of the incident wave is unbounded,
a sufficiently large value of σ must be chosen to ensure that the imaging functional (1.2)
remains bounded for any sampling points located away from the measured surface. In
particular, we can set σ = 0 when the incident wave is a Gaussian-modulated pulse wave.
On the other hand, there usually exists some measured noise in the measurement data.
Therefore, we must select a small enough value σ to ensure that the maximum value of
the imaging functional is not annihilated by the measured noise. Hence, it is important to
select an appropriate σ for the inversion and imaging. For a specific model, the optimal
choice of such σ is still open.
4. Numerical experiments
In this section, several two dimensional numerical examples are presented to illustrate
the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed time-domain direct sampling methods.
To generate synthetic scattered field data, we use the finite element method to solve
the forward problem of (1.1) and (2.4) in the time domain. Here, the quadratic finite
element discretization in space and Crank-Nicolson scheme in time are employed, and the
unbounded exterior domain is truncated by an absorbing boundary condition. The mesh
of the forward solver is gradually refined until the relative error of the measured data is
below 0.1%. To test the stability of the proposed method, random noise was added to
the synthetic scattered data ps (x, t). The noisy data are given by the following formula
psδ := ps (1 + δR),
where R are point-wise uniform random numbers, ranging from −1 to 1, and δ > 0 represents the noise level. Unless otherwise specified, 10% noise was added to the synthetic
data for the inversion.

14

Noting that the amplitude of the signal gradually decreases according to the proposed
imaging functions(1.2), therefore, in practical computations, we only need to utilize measurement data within a finite time. Thus, the imaging functionals (1.2) in 2D can be
truncated by

where T > 0 is the terminal time. In what follows, we use this truncated imaging
functional to identify the unknown targets. Next, we specify discretization details of the
above imaging functionals. Suppose that Nm receivers are equidistantly distributed on
the boundary Γ, i.e., xm ∈ Γ, m = 1, 2, ..., Nm . Meanwhile, the observation period is
divided into Nt equidistant recording time instants, that is, tn ∈ (0, T ], n = 1, 2, ..., Nt .
For simplification, the distance between two adjacent receivers and the time step are set
to be ∆Γ and ∆T , respectively. Furthermore, we assume that the sampling domain D
is enclosed by the measurement surface Γ such that Ω ⊂ D. In what follows, we use a
uniformly distributed Nh × Nh and Nh × Nh × Nh sampling mesh Th over the sampling
domain D for two and three dimensions, respectively. Hence, for each sampling point
zℓ ∈ Th , ℓ = 1, 2, ..., Nhd , we compute the discretized imaging functions with a single
source (1.2) by

In what follows, time step is chosen as ∆T = 0.02s and the background speed is set to
be c0 = 4m/s. In addition, a 60 × 60 sampling grid is used in the following numerical
experiments.
4.1. Reconstruction of point-like scatterers with a single source. In this part,
we aim to reconstruct multiple point-like scatterers by a single monopole source with
different incident signals. In what follows, we consider three kinds of causal temporal
signals as the incident source, that is, Gaussian-modulated sinusoidal pulse wave, smooth
sawtooth wave and tempered sinusoidal wave.
We assume that the single source is located at (−3, 0) and 48 receivers are distributed
on the observation circle with radius r = 4.2. Moreover, the sampling domain is chosen
as D = [−2.5, 2.5] × [−2.5, 2.5]. Figure 2(a) presents the two-dimensional geometrical
setting of the time-domain acoustic scattering problem, where the location of single
incident source is marked by the red point, the locations of receivers are marked by the
black points, the point-like scatterers are plotted as the blue curves and the sampling
domain is marked by the dotted square.
Firstly, we consider the Gaussian-modulated sinusoidal pulse wave as the incident
signal, which is given by

with center (−1, 1.5), semi-major axis 0.12 and semi-minor axis 0.08. The sound speed

c(x) inside the disk, square and elliptic are 15, 30 and 10, respectively. Noting that the
incident wave is a Gaussian-modulated sinusoidal pulse wave, as discussed in remark 3.3,
we can set σ = 0 in this example.
(2)
Figure 3 presents the contour plots of the imaging functional Ieδ (z) by using the
Gaussian pulse as the incident wave with different center frequencies. It can be seen that
the the imaging functional attains a significant local maximum near the exact locations
of the point-like scatterers. In comparison of the imaging results among figure 3(a)-(c),
one can observe that the resolution of the reconstruction is significant improved as ω0
increases. Furthermore, from figure 3(c)-(f), we can find that the point-like scatterers is
less precisely captured as the aperture decreases.
Secondly, we consider a smooth sawtooth wave as the incident wave, which is parameterized as

(0, 0) and (1.5, 1.5). The sound speed c(x) inside the disks are 10, 20 and 40, respectively.
Figure 4(b) plots the truncated waveform of the smooth sawtooth wave. In this numerical example, the parameter σ is chosen as 0.2. As shown in figure 4(c)-(f), it is clear
to see that the small scatterers are determined one by one as the terminal time increases.

The main reason is that we first receive the scattered field generated by the point-like
scatterer that is closest to the location of the incident source.
Finally, we consider a more challenging case. The incident wave is represented by a
tempered sinusoidal wave function, that is,

χ3 (t) :=

(2

0,

t ≥ 0,
t < 0.

Artificial scattered fields were collected with T = 10s and 500 recording time steps. The
true scatterers consists of a disk with radius 0.2 located at (−0.3, −0.3) and a square
with length 0.4 located at (0.3, 0.3). The sound speed c(x) inside these two domains is
given by 20 and 25, respectively. In Figure 5, we compare the reconstructed results using
different parameters σ. It illustrates that the resolution is dependent on the parameter
σ, which is in agreement with the theoretical analysis.

In the following examples, we consider a kite-shaped scatterer (see figure 6 (a)), which is
parameterized as
x(θ) = (cos θ + 0.65 cos 2θ − 0.65, 1.5 sin θ),

θ ∈ [0, 2π],

and a pear-shaped scatterer (see figure 8 (a)), which is parameterized as
x(θ) = (1.6 + 0.24 cos 3θ)(cos θ, sin θ),

θ ∈ [0, 2π],

We assume that there are 24 receivers placed on the boundary of a square with sidelength
10. The sampling domain is chosen as D = [−4, 4] × [−4, 4]. Figure 6(a) presents the
geometrical setting of the problem. Here the locations of the incident source are marked
by a red circle, the locations of receivers are marked by black points and the boundary
of the scatterer is plotted by the blue curve.
To begin with, we consider the reconstruction of a kite-shaped scatterer by using the
smooth sawtooth wave, which is generated by single incident wave source. Here the
parameter σ is set to be 0.1, the terminal time is T = 8s and 400 recording time is
obtained. Unfortunately, it is hardly to determine the shape of the extended target, see
figure 6(b). To overcome this difficulty, we employ multiple incident sources to capture
more geometrical details of the target. In figure 7, we show the reconstructed results
with different number of incident sources. As expected, reconstructions become more
accurate when more transmitter locations are used.
Finally, we consider the reconstruction of a pear-shaped scatterer by using the tempered sinusoidal wave. The terminal time is T = 6s and 300 recording time is obtained.
From figure 8, we can find that our method performs well for the extended scatterer when
a suitable parameter σ is selected. The optimal choice of σ is still unclear and this will
be further investigated in our future work.
